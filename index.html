       <p>I was born in Israel in 1992 in a small village. I have 2 sisters, and I am the first born in my family.
       After I've graduated school, I left for a year of community service, to contribute and help in the south of Israel before drafting for the IDF. This year was a time I matured drastically, and mentally helped me get prepered for the IDF. I was drafted in March 2012, and Served for almost 5 years. I was discharged as a lieutenant. After my service I decided to clear my head, so I took 8 month gap for a world tour, in which I was lucky enough to travel Oceania and Asia, from east to west. At the end of this trip, I was recruited to the Israel consulate in NYC, and I've worked there for 2 years, until I've opened my own company for property management and real estate development. I lived in NYC for about 5 years.  </p>
